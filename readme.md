## Installation

```
npm install
```
## Q1
I found the answer: 144.
```
node q1.js
```
## Q2
I don't know Python. I somehow figured out the math equation. Then I rewrite the function in javascript in O(n) time and O(1) space. Cannot really figure out a better way to improve the mathematical calculation though.

## Q3
Reading a simple file 'confucius.txt' and the print out each line in random order.
```
node q3.js < confucius.txt
```
## Q4
The smart reminder project. This is a language-aware intelligent Slack bot for scheduling reminders and meetings with other Slack users in Google Calendar. For example, you can simply type "help me set up a meeting with @Obama tomorrow 2 pm to talk about Medicare" to your chat bot ,and then it will add this event on everybody's google calendar with details. I am proud of this project because it is fun, useful, and also super challenging. It's the first time for me to implement machine learning technology (api.ai for natural language processing) to really build an useful application. We used three major APIs: slack, google, and api.ai to build it. Node.js has the asynchronous nature thus making sure those three asynchronous calling of API working properly is very challenge. We used promise to solve this issue.

Another interesting project I also want to share is the finding_pi project. By using only a random generator (0, 1) and base math operate (+ - * /) to accurately estimate Pi.  This project helps me to demonstrate my coding skills as well as the solid knowledge from math and statistic. Challenging and fun. I really enjoyed this project. If you have a better idea on how to solve this problem or find any error from this solution please let me know!
